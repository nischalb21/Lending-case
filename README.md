# Project Name : Lending club Case study

## General Information

- The background of the project is to find out who could likely be be paying off the loan or be defaulted.
- The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. 
- What is the dataset that is being used?

>>Major Factors affecting the defaulters is:
Loan_amnt
Funded_amnt
Funded_amnt_inv
Terms_in_months
Int_rate_percent
Grade
Subgrade
Emp_length
Home_ownership
Purpose
Revol_bal
Loan_status
Revol_util_percent
Pub_rec_bankruptcies_b
Total_pymnt

#Observations after data visualizations and EDA: 

1. If loan term is 60 months then it has 25% average who default on loans as compared to loan term of 36 months which has 11% average who default on loans.

Also from the count plot, one can infer that number of entries of 36 months is approx 3 times number of entries of 60 months. Still it has 11% average who default on loans.

2.In Grade A-G the bad loan or the defaulters percentage has increased ,Hence Grade F & G has highest chance to get proned to be defaulters.

3.Among the subgrades too of lower Grades A to D - bad loan % increments in a consistent manner between the sub grades in each grade. Grades E to G already determined as higher risks.

F5 subgrade has the higher bad loan percentage

## Recomendations:

>>The records who is having Grade G,Highest Interest_Rate,Mire Bankruptcy_record,More Terms in months,Having Rent or Mortgage House,Purpose(Debt Consolidation,Credit card ),Low Annual_Income will have the affect to be the risky account and more tends to be a default applicant.
